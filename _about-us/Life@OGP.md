### Work From Anywhere
#### It's all about flexibility.
Currently, we are housed at WeWork CityHouse, right at the Central Business District (CBD) area. Choose to work at our open office space or work from home, or simply anywhere. It doesn't matter where you are, as long as the work gets done.


### Project Ownership
#### Own what you do at work.

Instead of the typical top-down approach towards building products and project ownership, most of our work come from our ground-up initiatives such as the annual Hack for Public Good. That makes us invested and proud of what we are working on.

### Compensation Policy
#### Transparency is key.
Compensation is a right, not a privilege. We ensure that everyone in the team is assessed and offered based on market worth instead of employment history. Topics surrounding compensation is not a taboo, and in fact kept transparent for everyone's discussion and regular review.

###  Performance Policy
#### We are all accountable for your performance.
We provide 360-degree feedback for everyone, ensuring that we improve and work towards being a consistently high-performing organisation.

### Socials and Learnings
Not everything is about work.
